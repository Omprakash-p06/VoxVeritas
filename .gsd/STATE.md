## Last Action
- Finished planning Phase 6 (Plan 6.1: Safety Evaluation).
- Decided to use Promptfoo's `http` provider to hit the local `http://localhost:8000/ask` endpoint to statically evaluate the RAG pipeline's safety bounds.

## Next Step
- `/execute 6` to write the YAML configs, the safety dataset, and the PowerShell evaluation helper script.


## Recent Changes
- Tracked Phase 1 execution across tasks 1.1 and 1.2
- Initialized FastAPI, vector store, and document parser.
