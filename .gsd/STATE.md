## Last Action
- Finished planning Phase 5 (Plan 5.1: Desktop Frontend Dashboard).
- Decided on Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS served directly by FastAPI to avoid Node/React bloat and maximize control over VRAM.
- Swapped Phase 5 and Phase 6 in ROADMAP to prioritize the UI per User instruction.

## Next Step
- `/execute 5` to build the frontend and serve it from `src/main.py`.


## Recent Changes
- Tracked Phase 1 execution across tasks 1.1 and 1.2
- Initialized FastAPI, vector store, and document parser.
