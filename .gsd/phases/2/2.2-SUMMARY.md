# Plan 2.2 Summary: RAG Pipeline & Cited Answers

## Tasks Completed
1. **Enhance Vector Store for Search**: Vector score `query_collection` function was successfully implemented and utilized `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
2. **Implement Contextual RAG Service**: Created `RAGService` to stitch query context and send appropriately augmented prompts to the Sarvam-1 LLM via `LLMService`.
3. **Create CLI Terminal Tester**: Script `tests/cli_chat.py` was created to test terminal-based interrogations of the LLM securely and interactively.

## Outcomes
- Vector database semantics functionally connected to LLM prompts.
- Answers safely generate citations pointing back to source records (if any).
- End-to-end inference tested locally via endpoints and terminal.
