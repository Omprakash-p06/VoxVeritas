# Execution Summary: Plan 9.1

- Wrote `scripts/download_models.py` to automate HGF fetching of Sarvam-1 and Llama-3.2-3B.
- Refactored `src/services/llm_service.py` to support `load_model(mode)` which safely deletes the old model from VRAM and re-initializes `llama-cpp-python` with the new weights, ensuring we stay within the 4GB limit.
- Exposed `get_current_model_info` for health tracking.
