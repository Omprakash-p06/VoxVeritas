# Execution Summary: Plan 9.3

- Updated `src/api/health.py` to extract and report the active model name from `LLMService`.
- Modified `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` to create the "Active Model" top bar.
- Implemented a "Normal Chatbot Mode (Bypass RAG)" UI toggle that injects `chat_mode` into the API request payload.
- Built a Document Library pane that calls `/documents` to list files and `/document/{doc_id}` via DELETE to remove them.
