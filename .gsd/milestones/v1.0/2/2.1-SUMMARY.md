# Plan 2.1 Summary: LLM Engine Integration

## Tasks Completed
1. **Cleanup Placeholder Models**: Confirmed `.data/models` directory was empty initially.
2. **Install LLM Dependencies**: Installed `llama-cpp-python` successfully using CPU-only prebuilt wheels for system compatibility.
3. **Implement Local LLM Service**: Hooked `LLMService` to load `bartowski/sarvam-1-GGUF`. Successfully downloaded the 1.5GB GGUF model and verified generation with `pytest`.
4. **Create Base Generation Endpoint**: `POST /chat` endpoint is mapped and verified to generate valid responses.

## Outcomes
- Avoided MSVC build errors by utilizing appropriate compiler-free wheels.
- API can serve the Sarvam LLM inferences without memory leaks.
