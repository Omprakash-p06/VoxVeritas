# Plan 1.1 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Initialize Python Project**: Created `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and `.gitignore`. Successfully created a virtual environment and installed the dependencies for Phase 1 and 2.
- **Scaffold FastAPI App**: Created `src/main.py`, `src/api/health.py`, and `src/core/logging.py` using loguru. The `GET /health` endpoint works correctly.

## Verification
- Dependencies installed without conflicts.
- `GET /health` returned `{"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0"}`.
