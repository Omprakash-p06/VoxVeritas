# Execution Summary: Plan 10.2

- Wired the Screen OCR functionality into the text-based `/ask` and `/chat` endpoints.
- Updated `RAGService.ask_question` to intelligently merge document context and screen capture content when requested.
- Modified the frontend `ChatView.tsx` and the `api/query.ts` glue code to respect the "SCREEN OCR" toggle during text queries.
- Ensured that the assistant maintains its strict document/screen-grounding persona even when processing OCR context.
- Verified that the backend correctly captured and utilized the Windows desktop content during chat sessions.
