# Execution Summary: Plan 10.1

- Reinstalled `llama-cpp-python==0.3.1` using a pre-built CUDA 12.1 wheel to enable GPU offloading for inference.
- Updated `src/services/vector_store.py` to increase `max_distance` from `0.65` to `1.6`, ensuring relevant document chunks are properly included in the RAG context.
- Fixed hallucination issues in `src/api/qa.py` and `src/services/rag_service.py` by forcing `mode="chat"` for the `/chat` endpoint and using proper Llama 3 Instruction tokens (`<|start_header_id|>`) instead of ChatML tags.
- Verified that the backend correctly routes queries and generates coherent English/conversational output in direct chat mode.
