# Execution Summary: Plan 10.3

- Enhanced the `ChatView` header to include a live "Model Indicator" badge.
- The badge dynamically updates based on the user's selected mode (RAG vs Direct), reflecting the backend model swapping logic.
- Applied pixel-art inspired styling to maintain the "Retro-Accessibility" aesthetic of VoxVeritas.
- Confirmed that the UI correctly labels 'Sarvam-1' for RAG queries and 'Llama-3.2' for conversational chat.
