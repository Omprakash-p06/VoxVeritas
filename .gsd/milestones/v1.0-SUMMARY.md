# Milestone: v1.0 (Core Multilingual Assistant)

## Completed: 2026-02-22

## Deliverables
- ✅ **End-to-end voice query pipeline**: Integrated Whisper STT and Kokoro TTS.
- ✅ **Screen reading capability**: Native Windows OCR triggered by voice or UI.
- ✅ **Document grounded answers**: RAG implementation with Sarvam-1 and ChromaDB.
- ✅ **Multilingual Support**: Supports English, Hindi, and Bengali inputs.
- ✅ **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for RTX 3050 (2.3GB VRAM footprint).
- ✅ **Accessibility UI**: Glassmorphic, simple interface with model indicators.

## Phases Completed
1. Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
2. Phase 2: Core RAG & LLM Integration
3. Phase 3: Voice-First Pipeline
4. Phase 4: Screen Reading & Accessibility
5. Phase 5: Desktop Frontend Dashboard
6. Phase 6: Safety Evaluation
7. Phase 7: Integration Testing
8. Phase 8: Frontend-Backend Integration
9. Phase 9: UX Refinement
10. Phase 10: Critical Fixes & Finalization

## Metrics
- **Performance**: < 3s end-to-end latency on RTX 3050.
- **Accuracy**: > 95% grounding match in test evaluations.

## Lessons Learned
- **VRAM Management**: Loading multiple local models requires strict singleton management and `gc.collect()` during swaps.
- **OCR Limitations**: Platform-specific implementations (WinRT vs Tesseract) are necessary for low-latency desktop reading.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Instruct models require specific headers (`<|start_header_id|>`) to avoid gibberish output.
